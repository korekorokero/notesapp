For integration with Firebase Realtime Database I watched a [tutorial video on how to do it](https://youtu.be/DnH8AuR4S2A?si=BZczA2neI8a5VFMJ), and I used GitHub Copilot to make it fit and fix any error within my app. Other than that, I referred to projects that I've made before to make the pages, classes, widgets, etc.
